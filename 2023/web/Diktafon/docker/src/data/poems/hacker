In a digital realm, dark and dim,
A hacker sought to prove their vim,
With fingers poised, they typed away,
To conquer challenges, win the day.

In the depths of the CTF domain,
They navigated, trying to gain,
Access to secrets, codes, and keys,
With a hacking prowess, sure to please.

But alas, their skills were quite amiss,
As they fumbled through the cryptographic abyss,
Their code a tangled, buggy mess,
A hacker's nightmare, we must confess.

They cursed their luck, and cursed the screen,
Their fingers twitched, their mind grew mean,
As time ticked on, they realized with dread,
The CTF challenge had gone to their head.

The puzzles laughed in digital glee,
As the hacker's hopes sank in the sea,
Of ones and zeros, bytes and bits,
Their once-promising hack had turned to fits.

With every attempt, the hacker's despair,
Grew deeper, like a pit of nightmare,
For in the end, their fate was sealed,
Their hacking dreams were never revealed.

So here's a lesson for those who dare,
To hack and crack in the digital air,
In the world of CTF, where challenges roam,
Beware, dear hacker, of a bad poem.
